= JFDB
:Author: Jared Flatow

WARNING: `JFDB` is experimental technology.
         There may be breaking changes to the API.
         There may be serious bugs (none currently known, please report if you discover any).
         Use at your own risk.

[[about]]
== What is it?

`JFDB` is a database library written in `C`, but designed primarily for use in `Erlang`.
That is to say, the interface and architecture were designed to match the impedance of `Erlang`,
and also to fill a missing sweet spot in the `Erlang` ecosystem.
That is not to say that it isn't useful in other languages, or that the `C` interface is not usable.

`JFDB` aims to provide:

 - Searchability
 - Flexibility
 - Persistence
 - Performance
 - Convenience
 - Fault tolerance

The conceptual model for `JFDB` looks something like this:

----
 primary => value <= [indices, ...]
----

This is the atomic primitive unit of storage provided by `JFDB`.
All the keys (primary and indices) are compressed using an adaptive trie implementation called a `JFT`.

`JFDB` allows you to lookup values by primary key.
A conceptual model for data retrieval looks something like:

----
 primary => value | undefined
----

Or you may search using logical combinations of the index keys, e.g.:

----
 {any, [i1, {all, [i2, i3]}, {but, [i4, i5]}]} => [v1, v2, ...]
----

In addition, `JFDB` can do magical things with key prefixes (see <<usage>>).

`JFDB` never mutates data in place, so in a certain sense it cannot be corrupted.
If you are familiar with log-structured merge trees, you could think of `JFDB` as a log-structured merge __tr**i**e__.
Compared to something like `LevelDB` however, `JFDB` has much less overhead.

A database instance is extremely lightweight, consisting of 2 (sometimes 3) files.
For a better understanding of how it works, please read <<implementation>>

[[usage]]
== How do I use it?

First off, you need to get the code and build it:

----
$ make
----

From here on out, we'll be talking mainly about the `Erlang` bindings, not the `C` API or command-line interface.
First, make sure everything works properly:

----
$ cd erlang
$ make tests
----

[NOTE]
.To use as a dependency in an erlang.mk project, add something like:
====
-----
dep_jfdb = git https://github.com/jflatow/jfdb.git
ERL_LIBS = $(DEPS_DIR)/jfdb/erlang
-----
====

=== Opening and closing databases

Let's open an `Erlang` shell:

----
$ erl -pa ebin
----

Now, we can create a db named `basic-db` in the current directory:

----
> DB = jfdb:open("basic-db").
----

This will create a file named `basic-db.keys` and another named `basic-db.vals`.
Opening a database always creates these files if they do not exist.

The database will be closed when the term is garbage collected, however there are some drawbacks to relying on this.

WARNING: Only ever open one instance a particular db (i.e. the same path) at a time.
         Seriously, this is very important.
         If you fail to adhere to this, undefined behavior can occur, including data corruption and/or VM crashes.
         If you plan to reopen a database, do not rely on it automatically closing.

To explicitly close the database yourself, just do:

----
> DB = jfdb:close(DB).
----

NOTE: Most functions (except for retrieval operations) return `DB = {jfdb, <<>>} | {error, Reason}`.
      In the case of `close` here, we use the match to assert that nothing goes wrong during the operation.

Once you call `close` on a database, you should not use it again in any other operation.

Finally, we can also open a database __temporarily__.
That means, the database files will be deleted when it is closed.
This is primarily useful for things like testing, however there may be other use cases in the <<future,future>>.
To do that:

----
> DB = jfdb:open("tmp-db", [temporary]).
----

==== Keys, values, and paths

Now that we know how to open and close a db, let's free our variable binding, and open it again:

----
> f(DB), DB = jfdb:open("basic-db").
----

Let's try storing a simple key and value:

----
> DB = jfdb:assign(DB, key, val).
----

Then we can read it back:

----
> val = jfdb:lookup(DB, key).
----

And we can look at all our keys:

----
> [<<"k">>, <<"key">>] = jfdb:keys(DB).
----

You probably noticed that upon reading, our keys became binaries.
That's because any keys we give are implicitly mapped to binaries.

You may have also noticed that the keys are sorted.
That is not a coincidence: keys are always prefix compressed and ordered.
On the other hand, values are always returned exactly as they are specified.

NOTE: There are actually two levels of interface provided by the `Erlang` bindings.
      We're mainly dealing with the higher level one, which supports things like key paths and nested objects.
      You may also use the lower level interface, which deals only with the raw binary data.
      That interface is not recommended, though that is the only option available in `C`.
      The `keys` function is the only raw function we will mention, from now on we will deal only with `paths`.

Getting a little fancier, let's try using a *path* instead of a simple key.
We'll also store a slightly more complex value:

----
> DB = jfdb:assign(DB, [path, to, a], #{a => <<"ok">>}).
> DB = jfdb:assign(DB, [path, to, b], #{b => <<"ok">>}).
----

Paths allow us to store hierarchical data.
This is not unlike a file system which contains directories and files.
We will soon see <<sub-dbs,sub-dbs>> which are like directories, as opposed to the values we have been using, which are like files.
Later when we look at <<indices,indices>>, we will see that `JFDB` is not just like a file system, but rather a _tagged_ file system.

If that didn't make any sense, don't worry, let's just see what happens when we use paths:

----
> jfdb:lookup(DB, [path, to]).
[{<<"a">>,#{a => <<"ok">>}},
 {<<"b">>,#{b => <<"ok">>}}]
----

If we only care about whether or not a path exists in the db:

----
> true = jfdb:exists(DB, [path, to]).
----

We can remove full paths, or just the prefixes:

----
> DB = jfdb:remove(DB, [path, to]).
> false = jfdb:exists(DB, [path, to]).
----

[[sub-dbs]]
=== Sub-dbs

What happens if we just look at the first component of our path?
There's no value there, so what do we get back?
Well, we still get back an object, but for each key we get back a *sub-db*:

----
> [{<<"to">>, Sub}] = jfdb:lookup(DB, [path]).
----

For the most part, we can use the sub-db the same way we would use a db:

----
> jfdb:lookup(Sub, a).
#{a => <<"ok">>}
> jfdb:lookup(Sub, b).
#{b => <<"ok">>}
----

[[indices]]
=== Indices and search

So far, so good, but the real _raison d'Ãªtre_ for `JFDB` is to support searching arbitrary properties of a (mutable) dataset.
`JFDB` is not _just_ an efficient way to store complex `Erlang` terms on disk, without any meaningful size limits.
Using indices (which are keys / paths exactly like the primary keys we discussed above), you get fast, multi-dimensional access to your data.
The indices are first class citizens in `JFDB`, which means they are atomically written together with the primary key and value.
It also means indices get prefix compressed, just like primaries.

Creating indices is easy:

----
> DB = jfdb:assign(DB, k1, v1, [[time, a], [place, p1]]).
> DB = jfdb:assign(DB, k2, v2, [[time, b], [place, p1]]).
> DB = jfdb:assign(DB, k3, v3, [[time, a], [place, p2]]).
----

So is searching:

----
> jfdb:search(DB, [time, a]).
[{<<"k1">>,v1},{<<"k3">>,v3}]
> jfdb:search(DB, {all, [[time, a], [place, p1]]}).
[{<<"k1">>,v1}]
> jfdb:search(DB, {but, [{any, [[time, a], [time, b]]}, [place, p2]]}).
[{<<"k2">>,v2},{<<"k1">>,v1}]
----

Notice how when searching, the return items are not always in order.
If you are searching for a single index key, the order is guaranteed.
All bets are off when performing complex queries over multiple keys.

We can search prefix paths too.
Another way to restate the last query we executed could be:

----
> jfdb:search(DB, {but, [[time], [place, p2]]}).
[{<<"k2">>,v2},{<<"k1">>,v1}]
----

That is ``has time but not place p2''.

In addition, we can use arbitrary prefixes, not just components of the path.
For instance, let's suppose we want to support text search on value:

----
> DB = jfdb:assign(DB, [some, path], #{first_name => <<"Jared">>, last_name => <<"Flatow">>}, [[word, <<"Jared">>], [word, <<"Flatow">>]]).
----

We invented the word keyspace for our text search so that it doesn't interfere with any other keys we have.
Now we can search a prefix, e.g. as a user types:

----
> jfdb:search(DB, {pre, [word, <<"Ja">>]}).
[{[<<"some">>,<<"path">>],
  #{first_name => <<"Jared">>,last_name => <<"Flatow">>}}]
----

One more thing worth knowing, is that we can list indices, not just primaries:

----
> jfdb:paths(DB, [], [indices]).
[[<<"place">>,<<"p1">>],
 [<<"place">>,<<"p2">>],
 [<<"time">>,<<"a">>],
 [<<"time">>,<<"b">>],
 [<<"word">>,<<"Flatow">>],
 [<<"word">>,<<"Jared">>]]
----

That second argument is a path.
Remember, paths can mention prefixes:

----
> jfdb:paths(DB, {pre, [place, p]}, [indices]).
[<<"1">>,<<"2">>]
----

I mean it, they can _always_ use prefixes:

----
> jfdb:lookup(DB, {pre, [some, path]}).
[{[],#{first_name => <<"Jared">>,last_name => <<"Flatow">>}}]
----

If you understand why that last example returned an item tuple and not just a value, then you are really grokking `JFDB`.

[[compaction]]
=== Flushing and crushing

If you want to ensure a write gets to disk, you have 3 options:

 1. Add the `flush` option to the write call, i.e. `jfdb:assign(DB, Path, Val, Indices, [flush])`
 2. Call `flush` on the db, i.e. `jfdb:flush(DB)`
 3. Call `crush` on the db, i.e. `jfdb:crush(DB)`

Unlike `flush`, `crush` will actually compact the db into a single level.
This normally happens automatically, but you can do it manually, e.g. if you want to optimize for reading.
For more information about what this means, see <<implementation>>.

[[performance]]
== How fast is it?

Well, that's an impossible question, it depends on your use case.
But here are some quick tests from the root directory of `JFDB`.

----
time test/jfdb test-db
----

That's using the `C` API, and on my MacBook Pro I get *~30-40K* writes per second.

Using the `Erlang` API:

----
time (cd erlang && test/jfdb erl-test-db assign 10000)
time (cd erlang && test/jfdb erl-test-db lookup 10000)
----

For me, that comes to *~5K* writes per second, and *~20K* reads per second.

All these tests use pretty trivial keys and values, and are actually doing stuff besides just reading and writing the values.
They also don't use any of the advanced features of `JFDB`.
I'd love to see your benchmarks!

[[implementation]]
== How does it work?

This is a work in progress, the authoritative answer to this is _read the code_.
There are really only *~2500* lines of code in https://github.com/jflatow/jfdb/tree/master/src[jfdb/src] that do the bulk of the work.
The fancy querying is mostly part of the `Erlang` bindings under https://github.com/jflatow/jfdb/blob/master/erlang/c_src/jfdb_nif.c[erlang/c_src/jfdb_nif.c].

Essentially there are 2 files, `.keys` and `.vals`.
The `.keys` file contains the tries (more detail to come).
The `.vals` file contains bulk value data, allocated in blocks.
Both files are mmapped.

Here are a couple of random notes on the `Erlang` bindings for now:

 - the nif has its own queue / thread, it will not block the scheduler
 - the resource uses < `4KB` memory overhead per db
 ** `JFT_KEY_LIMIT` defaults to `1KB`, i.e. maximum of `1024` bytes per key.
     You can change the limit to match your data, the largest possible is `4KB`.
    `256B` is enough for most, `512B` or `1KB` is probably more than enough for anyone.
 ** 2 key data buffers in `Erlang` bindings
 ** 1 key data buffer in the core db

[[future]]
== What's next?

I've been thinking a lot about memory-only dbs and complex transactions.
Also, possibly exposing the `JFT` objects (tries) directly to `Erlang`.
These are highly related topics.
More on this to come...
